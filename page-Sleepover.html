        <p> The Sleepover</p>
        <p>On that night, I was hinted by my underlying attraction towards you. That was also the time I 
            started to ask myself on how I really felt about you, and oh boy, the thought never left my mind.
            I am dumbfounded for days, denying, ignoring and convincing myself to not fall into my own thoughts. 
            But I am glad I failed to do so because now, I am here with you and I feel like im the luckiest guy 
            alive because you chose to be with me.
         </p>
         <p>In the second time we had a sleep over, that was the night that I got finally convinced that It is 
            you who I wanted no matter what, as the days prior to it was nothing but missing you. Despite the 
            negative opinion of other people about us, I chose fight through it, I chose not to be a coward and 
            risked it, cause I believe that no matter what happens, it is going to be worth it with you.
