        <br>
        <p> Movies </p>
        <p> These are the times that I somehow get to know you more in a deeper aspect. I get to recognize how insightful
             and very attentive you are when it comes to details during the movies we have watched. I really admire the 
             moment where you are able to predict events and the causes/effects which enables me to understand the plot 
             considering I really have low attention span.</p>
        <p>One thing about these dates that had remain an impact in our relation ship, is it also had me realize that despite 
            the strong independent woman personality that you show, I was able to percieve the how brittle you could be and 
            this allowed me to shape myself on how to be a good partner tailored for you only. And to wrap things up, I would
             like to let you know that as your partner, I am more than happy to be able to bring you refuge in you morst vulnerable 
             moments.</p>
