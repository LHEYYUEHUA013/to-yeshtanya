        <br>
        <p>TO MY DEAREST.</p>
        <p>Happy 2nd monthsary, love,</p>
        <p>Time really flies so fast, I could almost recall 
            everything we did in these past few months like it was yesterday. 
            I am as happy as I was when we first got back together. As the days passes, 
            I get to know about you, understand, and appreciate you even more despite your imperfections. 
            I still remember the time when we were out there sa fuente talking and laughing on our on mischief 
            back when we were little, talking about anything we could think of while staring in your dazzling beauty
            , It felt peaceful. I want to relive those moment and just embrace every motion, every emotion that 
            we both felt at that very night.</p>
        <p>I know it might be too early to say this, love, but I really pray that you will be the one that I see in my 
            deathbed. In short, I want to live my whole life with you. I will work hard to improve, and fill our 
            lives with prosperity and serenity, build a household free from any toxic behaviors. I am not yet the 
            best version of myself, but I hope that you will accompany me while the both of us seek and chase after our separate
             dreams, in sickness, in health, when things does not go our way, and when things goes our way, in the midst of 
             depression, and amidst the euphoria.</p>
        <p>I would just like to convey my appreciation to all the things you have done for me. Although some of them my be too much 
            therefore I try to decline them, but the fact that you are willing to do it regardless, makes me feel so lucky to have 
            you in this lifetime. Thank you so much for being there, because of you, I learn to appreciate life even more.
             I love you so much, so much that It is hard to explain, so much that it trancends time and beyond eternity.</p>
