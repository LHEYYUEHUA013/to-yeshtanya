        <p> I REALLY LOVE THESE MOMENTS especially when we go hours of no talking then you suddenly text me with hot tea, and boy
            I really have fun everytime especially when you talk about your dad, kuya, your tita and your friend group ug about ni [REDACTED]. Although 
            sometimes I really dont know how should I reply to some of your chat cause some of them I feel like I should not have
             an opinion about because it can not be my business due to some ethical reason, but regardless, I feel so happy when 
             you share your thoughts even if they are really random because it makes me feel relevant. And due to these I find aspects of you very charming 
             and everyday Inaakit mo tlga ako BWAHAHAHAH, I am falling further for you type shii.
